hello fams

brown: #643d46

green: #20a563

For the pause menu: Idle buttons are brown, then the font is off-white and in Roboto Light. When clicked the button turns green and the the font is still off-white but in Roboto Black.

For the prompt: the color is reversed, so the idle buttons are off-white and the font is brown and in Roboto Light. When clicked the button turns green and the font is off-white and in Roboto Black (same as above hehe)
